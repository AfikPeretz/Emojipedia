# Emojipedia
In this project I created a dictionary of terms for emojis so that there would finally be conventions and everyone would know what each emoji means.      
In the project I used **React** to dynamically create Entry type components (with the help of the map function) so that for each Json that was added to the array called emojipedia, the component that will represent it will immediately be created.
